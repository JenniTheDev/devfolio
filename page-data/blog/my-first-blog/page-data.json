The only requirements were to use existing open source software, write some original code, and to use Version Control Software. I knew right from the start that I wanted to make a game.</p>\n<p>I debated between using two engines, Godot or LÖVE. I ended up choosing Godot since I had been learning how to use Unity and thought it would be similar. It also allowed more flexibility in what type of game I could make. LÖVE is only 2D. I also decided I wanted to make it school themed since it was a school project. I settled on Tuffy Tack because the school mascot is Tuffy the Titan, and I thought it would be cute to have him drive around.</p>\n<h3>Planning everything out</h3>\n<p>Since I had decided on the theme Tuffy Track, I started planning out my game. I knew I wanted Tuffy to drive a go kart around the track. I wanted the environment to be themed around the school campus. I thought it needed enemies, so I decided they could be professors that would be defeated by throwing homework at them. I also wanted a UI with lives and number of homework assignments turned in. I couldn’t forget the music, sound effects, and some menus.</p>\n<h3>Adjusting my expectations</h3>\n<p>Then I started building my game and I realized I had some really high expectations with the time I had, and my artistic ability. I’ve also never used Godot before. Then, a pandemic happened and my group member disappeared. I reassessed my project and broke it down into a few basic parts I had to complete. The first being the level for the character to play in, second being the character and it’s controller, and lastly some enemies.</p>\n<p>When I started out laying out the level, I figured I could use basic shapes for the campus buildings. When I started trying to place them like they were on campus, I realized that was going to take a very long time to do. I scaled it back and just did that six buildings that make up the Computer Science department. If I had time, I could make additional levels based on different campus areas. I then watched some tutorials and combined the things I learned to make the character controller and first person camera. Soon I had the scene set up and my character looking and walking around.</p>\n<p>After that, I set up some coins to collect and the enemies. I didn’t originally plan on having coins, but I thought the player might need some incentive to move around the zone. I found a great resource, <a href=\"https://opengameart.org/\">Open Game Art</a>, and used it to find some enemies for my game. Importing assets taught me the basics of using Blender. Since I found an animated walking character in Open Game Art, I learned to adjust the animation and create the pathing of the enemies.</p>\n<h2>It works!</h2>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <figure class=\"video_container\"> <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PpVLFv9TMiA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe> </figure> </div>\n<p>At that point I had a working game. The player could walk around the zone, collect coins, and die when they hit an enemy. Since the deadline for the project was coming soon, I felt I had two options. I could either try to add more enemies, coins, or a kart and track to the game; or I could polish it up with some environmental assets and sound. I decided that I wanted the game to feel finished when I presented it to the class, so I added in the environmental trees, the soundtrack, and menus. When these were done, I wrote up the documentation and submitted my project.</p>\n<p>At first I found Godot’s setup a little confusing compared to Unity’s, but I picked it up quickly. This project gave me the opportunity to learn how to use Godot and what steps it takes to make a game. You can find the GitHub for my project <a href=\"https://github.com/JenniTheDev/TuffyTrack\">here</a>. It includes the initial plan and the documentation.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Tuffy Track with ... no track","date":"May 01, 2020","description":"How my game Tuffy Track ended up with no track.
